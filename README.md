### Introduction
Automatically describing the content of an image fundamental problem in artificial intelligence that connects computer vision and natural language processing. In this project, we present a generative model based on a deep current architecture that combines recent advances in puter vision and machine translation and that can be to generate natural sentences describing an image. model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target scription sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and fluency of the language it learns solely from image descrip tions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we both qualitatively and quantitatively. 

For instance, the current state-of-the-art BLEU-1 score (the higher better) on the Pascal dataset is 25, our approach yields to be compared to human performance around 69. We show BLEU-1 score improvements on Flickr30k, from 56 66, and on SBU, from 19 to 28. Lastly, on the newly released COCO dataset, we achieve a BLEU-4 of 27.7, which is current state-of-the-art.
